This project showcases a personal webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes semantic structure, custom styling, and a simple animation, and is deployed live via Render.

## Technical Achievements  
- **Styled page with CSS**: Applied 5 distinct rules including font styling, background color, header color, table borders, and link hover effects.  
- **JavaScript Animation**: Implemented a color-changing animation on the header using `setInterval()`.  
- **Semantic HTML Tags**: Used `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<ul>`, `<table>`, and `<img>` for meaningful structure.

## Design Achievements  
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: Applied Roboto site-wide for clean, modern typography.  
- **Created and Applied a Custom Color Palette**: Designed a palette using Adobe Color and applied all colors across the site. Screenshot included in the repo.
